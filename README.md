# Trackster

Trackster is a simple, Elixir-powered API-driven application to help you track hobbies, todos, journal entries, and habits. The app includes a streak feature that encourages consistency in your daily routines.

Built with Elixir and designed for the Nerves framework, Trackster is optimized to run on low-cost devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W which I built this for.
